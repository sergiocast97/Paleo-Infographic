# Paleo Infographic

This project was part of a Data Visualization course, where we had to take a number of datasets of our choice, and build a poster around it, by applying all sorts of data science techniques to them and retrieving some interesting information.

I decided to use paleontology as my focus, a topic that I started reading a lot about during lockdown and which ended up kindling a long lost passion (Who didn't love dinosaurs as a kid?)

I used 2 datasets from Kaggle, the Dinosaur List by Kumazaki98 and the Paleobiology Database by Jorge Orellano. Furthermore, I did some web scraping from Wikipedia to retrieve the length of the different Mesozoic periods. The data processing and a further explanation of how the different visualizations were achieved can be viewed from on my GitHub repository.

Finally, I would like to give credit to the paleoartists Gabriel Ugueto, Julio Lacerda and Mario Lanzas for the amazing paleoart that gave some life to these visualizations.
